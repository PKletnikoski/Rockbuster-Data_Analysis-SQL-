# SQLRockbusterStealthDataAnalysisProject
A data analysis project using PostgreSQL to analyze data from a fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC.

KEY QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

What was the average rental duration for all videos?

Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

TOOLS

Language: PostgreSQL Software: pgAdmin, DbVisualizer, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint

DEMONSTRATED SKILLS

Database Querying and Filtering Data: Identify SQL syntax for ordering, limiting, grouping data, organizing and sorting data
Summarizing and Cleaning data: Checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.
Joining tables: Selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.
Performing Subqueries: Writing subqueries to answer complex business questions
Descriptive Statistics: Exploring basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse.
Presenting results: Creating visualizations of SQL results, creating a Tableau story and PowerPoint presentation with answers to key questions and recommendations.
